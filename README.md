### Requirements:
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Necessary libraries installed: `tkinter`, `opencv-python`, `numpy`, `pygame`, `keras`, `PIL`.

### How to Use:

1. **Run the Application:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where the Python script is saved.
   - Run the script using the command `python <filename>.py`.

2. **Load Camera:**
   - Click on the "Load Camera" button to initialize the webcam.
   - If multiple cameras are available, select the desired one from the drop-down menu.

3. **Detect Emotion:**
   - After loading the camera, click on the "Detect Emotion" button to start the emotion detection process.
   - The application will continuously analyze the webcam feed to detect faces and emotions.

4. **Enjoy Music:**
   - Based on the detected emotion, the application will play corresponding music.
   - Each emotion has its predefined music file stored in the "Music" folder.

5. **Stop Detection:**
   - Click on the "Stop" button to pause the emotion detection process.

6. **Toggle Full Screen:**
   - Click on the "Full Screen" button to switch between full-screen and windowed mode.

7. **Exit Application:**
   - Click on the "Exit" button to close the application.
   - Ensure to stop emotion detection before exiting to release the camera resources.

### Notes:
- Ensure that the required emotion detection model (`modelv1.h5`) is present in the specified location.
- Music files corresponding to different emotions should be stored in the "Music" folder.
- The application uses pre-trained Haar cascade for face detection and a CNN model for emotion recognition.
- Adjust the aspect ratio and size thresholds in the `detect_emotion` function based on your requirements.
- You can customize the music files and their associations with different emotions in the `play_music` function.

### Libraries Used:
- **tkinter**: For GUI development.
- **cv2**: OpenCV library for computer vision tasks.
- **numpy**: For numerical computations.
- **pygame**: For playing music.
- **keras.models**: For loading a pre-trained emotion recognition model.
- **os**: For operating system operations.
- **threading**: For handling concurrent execution.
- **PIL**: Python Imaging Library for image processing.

        - `show_notification(message)`: Display a notification.
        - `resize_frame(frame)`: Resize the camera frame.
        - `update_camera()`: Update the camera feed.
        - `detect_emotion()`: Start emotion detection.
        - `detect_emotion_process()`: Process emotion detection.
        - `stop_detection()`: Stop emotion detection.
        - `toggle_fullscreen()`: Toggle fullscreen mode.
        - `exit_application()`: Exit the application.
4. **`detect_emotion(frame)`**: Function to detect emotion in a frame.

### Buttons and Interfaces:
- **Load Camera Button**: Load the selected camera device.
- **Detect Emotion Button**: Start emotion detection.
- **Stop Button**: Stop emotion detection.
- **Full Screen Button**: Toggle fullscreen mode.
- **Exit Button**: Exit the application.

The program captures emotions through the webcam, detects them using a pre-trained model, and plays music accordingly. It provides a GUI interface for user interaction.
